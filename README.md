# ReadADay

## Inspiration
While change for social good relies on action and voices from the younger generation, we often fall short due to performative activism and treating movements like fads. With ReadADay, we're striving to build a mindset of staying informed, starting discussions, and moving towards reform day by day.

## How We Built This
We built an iOS app, backed by a Node.js/Express server and Azure technologies, that displays articles for users to read covering a wide variety of topicsâ€” from movements around racial equity to pushes for environmental sustainability and conservation.

Once a user reads an article, this is added to their profile, and their ReadADay "reading streak" increases. This reading streak, inspired by the activity streaks feature on watchOS and the streaks feature on Snapchat, encourages users to come back day-after-day to continue educating themselves about issues that impact themself, their their community, and their world.

We utilized Azure Text Analytics to identify key phrases in articles to place them into categories (currently limited to Civil Rights, Sustainability, and Health in recognition of BLM and the pandemic.

## Future Goals
There are a lot of features we would implement if we had more time. For instance, we want to add more of a social media aspect to the application, that includes leaderboards and easy acessibility to share apps. We would also focus more on doing proper authentication and doing more user design & research to ensure to make the UI more crisp.
